Module 20 - Supervised Learning Models




## Description

This contains my submission for module 20 of the UTA Data Analytics Bootcamp. We were tasked with creating a logistical regression model to try to predict the risk of loans given a lending_data.csv dataset. The goal was to review terms like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy and understand the basic workflow of cleaning data, separating features/target, applying scaling/encoding (one hot), splitting the training/test data, creating and fitting a model, and then generating predictions according to test data, and then parameter optimization while trying to avoid over fitting and other possible model breakdowns. 

Admittedly, the notebook we received was rather minimal, so not too much of this workflow is actually shown.
